# Feature Extraction

Aims to reduce the number of features in a dataset by creating new features from the existing ones (and then discarding the original features). These new reduced set of features should then be able to summarize most of the information contained in the original set of features.
In this way, a summarised version of the original features can be created from a combination of the original set.

Feature Extraction techniques lead to advantages such as:
    Accuracy improvements.
    Overfitting risk reduction.
    Speed up in training.
    Improved Data Visualization.
    Increase in explainability of our model.
