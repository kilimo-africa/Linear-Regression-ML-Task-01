Feature Selection is a data pre-processing activity automating the election of those features that contribute the most to the target variable.

A search problem to find the subset of relevant features

FS Methods:
  1. Embedders
  2. Filters
  3. Wrappers

Importance of Feature Selection
  • Reduces overfitting – the lesser the irrelevant data the more the more the model can generalize well
  • Improved model accuracy
  • Speeds up model training
